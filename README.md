# ash-script
A basic interpreter for a simple programming language, written for educational purposes

## Compiling
Make a new directory called 'bin' next to this file. Ensure make and gcc are installed, then run `make` to compile the interpreter. Once compiled, a new binary called 'ash-script' will be placed in the 'bin' directory.

## Running
To execute an ash-script file, simply run `./bin/ash-script <script-file>`. For instance, run `./bin/ash-script examples/pi.txt` to execute the Pi calculation example.
